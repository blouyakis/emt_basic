## Module 2:

>EMT basics do not carry tracheostomy masks or partial rebreather masks, we do carry non rebreather masks. While we could use a tracheostomy mask or partial rebreather if provided by the patient, I would not consider either typical for an EMT basic. I think both answers could be considered correct and would change this question by adjusting the answer options or changing the question. 

```
### Q55 ðŸŸ¡  
**Front**  
A ________ is not typically used in the prehospital setting for oxygen administration.  
Â· Nasal cannulaâ€ƒÂ· Regulatorâ€ƒÂ· **Partial rebreather mask**â€ƒÂ· Tracheostomy mask  

**Back**  
**Answer:** Partial rebreather mask 
```

>This question is ambiguous - remove the word 'again' from the answer and replace with 'assessment' for better clarity. The word again implies I am repeating the same thing I just did. While we are reassessing the ABCs during the rapid trauma assessment, it is not the same as the primary assessment when we are looking for immediate life threats. I interpreted this initially as both my primary and rapid trauma were complete, so the answer of 'rapid trauma again' would be incorrect, so I would choose 'immobilize on long backboard & perform detailed exam in ambulance.' Simply removing the word 'again' gets rid of the ambiguity.

Â· Immobilize on long backboard & perform detailed exam in ambulance 
Â· Perform tertiary assessment  
Â· **Rapid trauma again**

**Back**  
**Answer:** Rapid trauma again.

### Q3 ðŸŸ¢  
**Front**  
In what position should the patient complaining of severe abdominal pain be placed if there are no signs or symptoms of shock?  
Â· Supine with feet elevatedâ€ƒÂ· Left lateral recumbentâ€ƒÂ· Semi-Fowler with knees bentâ€ƒÂ· **One of comfort**  

**Back**  
**Answer:** Position of comfort (usually knees slightly flexed).  

### Q6 ðŸŸ¢  
**Front**  
You are treating a 38-year-old female patient with abdominal distress. Vital signs are stable, ready to transport. What is the best position?  
Â· **Position of comfort**â€ƒÂ· Semi-Fowlerâ€™sâ€ƒÂ· Right lateralâ€ƒÂ· Supine  

**Back**  
**Answer:** Whatever position she finds least painfulâ€”usually semi-Fowler with knees flexed.

### Q5 ðŸŸ¢  
**Front**  
In what condition does fluid accumulate in the lungs, preventing them from breathing adequately?  
Â· Pneumoniaâ€ƒÂ· **Pulmonary edema**â€ƒÂ· Pulmonary embolismâ€ƒÂ· Asthma  

**Back**  
**Answer:** Pulmonary edema.  

### Q7 ðŸŸ¢  
**Front**  
Which of the following is the name given to the condition in which fluid accumulates in the lungs?  
Â· Pedal edemaâ€ƒÂ· Dyspneaâ€ƒÂ· Congestive heart failureâ€ƒÂ· **Pulmonary edema**  

**Back**  
**Answer:** Pulmonary edema.  
```

>This question is difficult because while syncope is caused by the temporary lack of oxygen or blood flow to the brain, usually the underlying cause of this is cardiovascular in nature so many might be inclined to select 'heart' as the appropriate choice. 

```
### Q24 ðŸŸ¡  
**Front**  
Many factors that cause dizziness and syncope are generally related to the:
Â· Lungsâ€ƒÂ· Kidneysâ€ƒÂ· **Brain**â€ƒÂ· Heart 

**Back**  
**Answer:** Brain. 
```

>Consider changing one of the answer options. 'Airborne droplets & direct contact' & 'saliva & droplets' both seem to be correct. It is confusing the word 'droplets' - a person coughing could be considered an 'airborne' droplet vs 'saliva.' 

```
### Q91 ðŸŸ¢  
**Front**  
Mumps spread primarily through:  
Â· Blood & salivaâ€ƒÂ· Airborne droplets & direct contactâ€ƒÂ· **Saliva and droplets**â€ƒÂ· All body fluids  

**Back**  
**Answer:**  Saliva and droplets
```

## Module 4:

>This question is not clear to me. I would choose to immobilize the patient on a long spine board because there is a spinal injury. To assist in breathing, we would elevate the head of the long board 30 degrees. Placing a patient with a spinal injury on a cot is contraindicated because this does not immobilize the spine. 

```
### Q34 ðŸŸ¡  
**Front**  
A 79-year-old male lost his balance and fell, landing on his back. He complains of pain in his upper back, and you palpate a deformity to T-6. He has a history of CHF and tells you he needs to sit up so he can breathe. He is on home oxygen by nasal cannula, 3 L/minute. He is not able to feel below his xiphoid process or move his legs. You should apply a cervical collar and:
â€¢ Supine stretcher & NRBâ€ƒâ€¢ Supine stretcher Oâ‚‚ 15 Lâ€ƒâ€¢ Long-backboard immobilizationâ€ƒâ€¢ **Semi-Fowler on stretcher**  

**Back**  
**Answer:** Semi-Fowler on stretcher
```

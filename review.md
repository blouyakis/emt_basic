>EMT basics do not carry tracheostomy masks or partial rebreather masks, we do carry non rebreather masks. While we could use a tracheostomy mask or partial rebreather if provided by the patient, I would not consider either typical for an EMT basic. I think both answers could be considered correct and would change this question by adjusting the answer options or changing the question.

### Q55 ðŸŸ¡  
**Front**  
A ________ is not typically used in the prehospital setting for oxygen administration.  
Â· Nasal cannulaâ€ƒÂ· Regulatorâ€ƒÂ· **Partial rebreather mask**â€ƒÂ· Tracheostomy mask  

**Back**

>This question is ambiguous - remove the word 'again' from the answer and replace with 'assessment' for better clarity. The word again implies I am repeating the same thing I just did. While we are reassessing the ABCs during the rapid trauma assessment, it is not the same as the primary assessment when we are looking for immediate life threats. I interpreted this initially as both my primary and rapid trauma were complete, so the answer of 'rapid trauma again' would be incorrect, so I would choose 'immobilize on long backboard & perform detailed exam in ambulance.' Simply removing the word 'again' gets rid of the ambiguity.
